The warm sun cascaded down onto Zoes face as she lay on a bed of long grass beneath the great chestnut tree that grew near her family home.  The grass was prickly against her legs but she didn't mind. She loved lying here basking in the sunlight, cool breeze wafting the sweet scent of flowers and pollen from far away.
The upper branches rustled above her occasionally allowing beams of light to pierce its leafy shade. A fly buzzed past her face. Lifting a hand waft it away a large branch overhead shifted creating a bright light behind her eyelids. Spreading out her fingers to block the firey ball impossibly far away. 
The sun was still so bright against her face however. All she could see was the relentless bright light against her lids. But that didn't make any sense? Moving her hand once again to block the sun in front of her the golden ball vanish behind her fingers but to no avail.
 Opening her eyes in a flash, two hellishly red eyes blazed back down at her from upon high. A thundering voice vibrated through her bones "I..  See.. You!" 

Jolting awake Zoe sat bolt upright in her bedroll of animal furs. A blinding pain suddenly wracked her head as it crashed into the lower branches of the bushes she was camped beneath.
"Aieyah!" Zoe cried.
"What was it this time?" sam asked forlornly.
"I was lying in the grass near where we grew up watching the sky, but there was 2 sun. They morphed into these 2 horrific eyes watching me. Then it this terrible voice crashed through my very being. Thats never happened before" she added timidly.
"These night terrors are getting worse week by week" sam sighed
"Do you think it means something?" He asked, sidling over to kneel by the entrance to the burrow.
"You could be seeing the future Zoe, a warning from the Gods themselves." sam pondered seeming uneasy.
"I couldn't tell you sam, but this time it felt more like a warning. As though something big is about to happen.
Flopping back down onto the furs Zoe stretched out like a cat and curled up into a ball.
"Don't be getting too comfy Sis, it's your turn to watch right about now." Sam yawned "I'm about to fall down where I stand in a minuite.

As the long silence stretched out Sams eyes feeling heavier by the minuite he knew there was only one thing left to do. Skirting around the edge of the bushes until he was roughly where he thought the bottom of the the sleep roll must be. He stooped and lifted up the branches and shoved his arm inside until he could feel something soft.
Siezing hold as tight as he could he gave a mighty tug pulling the bed and Zoe right out of the bushes into the cool open air. In a flash the pile of furs at Sam feet burst open as Zoe sprang to her feet. Without a thought Sam let go of his stone tipped spear letting it clatter to the floor, he reached out with both hands to catch her wrists before she could land a strike. Giving them a gentle squeeze the 2 sharpened deer antlers dropped to the floor. 
Glaring up at him "You know, it's a mystery how we manage to avoid attracting the attention of every beast in the land with you around".
Letting go of her arms Sam crouched down by the bushes, "and its a wonder you're still alive".  
"hmph I can look after myself you know" Zoe shot back squatting down to run her hands over the dark ground searching for her weapons. 
Sam nudged his spear under the bushes and dropped to his knees, seizing the furs with one hand and rolling under the cover of the low hanging leaves. Finding her weapons Zoe sprang up to her feet, broad smile across her face, and gave her antlers a twirl in both hands before tucking them neatly into her leather belt.
Shuffling his body further out of sight Sam teased "I'm sure the next Yurk you come across will be so amazed by that perfomance he may let you live" Slipping completely out of sight now he covered himself with the furs and finally allowed his eyes to close.

"Ha freaking Ha" Zoe took a deep breathe of the cool night air and let out a long sigh to calm herself. She had known Sam as long as she could remember. Growing up they had always tested each other every chance they got. There was little place in the world for those who couldn't defend themselves. Many strange creatures roam the wilds of the forrests that surrounded the Pods.
